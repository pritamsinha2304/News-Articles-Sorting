This web app is built on the basis on the title and to predict news articles on user's input. The page is divided into 3 sections, which is based on user's input preference. Each section is well-defined and users can give inputs. Each section on predicting completely and successfully, will go to the metrics page, where all the metrics of the prediction results are shown.
